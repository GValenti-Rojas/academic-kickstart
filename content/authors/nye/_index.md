I graduated from Edinburgh univeristy in 2018 with a Masters in Physics. My thesis was on applications of Fourier Acceleration to lattice field theory.
From there I went on to my current possition as a PhD student under Michael Hartmann looking into applications of Superconducting circuits to Quantum Simulators.
I am also working with Patrik Ohbergs group researching things such as DMRG and Chiral Condensates in 1+1d. 

In my spare time i enjoy cycling and Hiking in the scottish highlands.
