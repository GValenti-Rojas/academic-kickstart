My research primarily concerns the theoretical study of strongly correlated quantum systems. In particular, I am interested in the study of quasicrystals, disordered/quasi-disordered systems, topological phenomena and applications of tensor networks to determine quantum phases. The models I study are defined on discrete geometries, typically derived from the tight-binding description of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice.

Research
======

Quasicrystals have no translational symmetry, unlike their periodic counterparts. They will, however, still possess long-range order. This can immediately be seen from the self-similar distribution of lattice sites, or more rigorously established from irrational projections of higher dimensional periodic lattices. 

Due to the inhomogeneous nature of these systems, exotic phases of matter can be found, including Density Waves; which may spontaneously break rotational symmetries and fill the lattice at incommensurate densities. For more details on this work, see our publication below.

Prior to this work, we have also studied the effects of generalised nonlocal interactions in periodic lattices. Using a mean-field theory, we found that competing interaction and tunnelling processes can produce a rich phase diagram, with many of the phases possessing a sign-staggered structure.

To better account for correlations and topological features present in certain models, entanglement must be incorporated. This can be done using Tensor Network (TN) representations of many-body quantum states and operators, where entanglement is now encoded within the contraction structure of the individual tensors.

For 1D and small 2D models, Matrix Product States/Operators (MPSs/MPOs) combined with Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG) can be used to study quantum phase transitions. In particular, I am interested in using DMRG for future projects in order to better understand correlated systems and emergent topological ground states.
